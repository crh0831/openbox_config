# openbox_config

Occasionally I get the itch to install the Openbox window manager.  With so many different components
I finally found a good mix that lets me get to working quickly.
This repo contains the setup scripts and files I need to get Openbox setup like I want.

## Dependencies

I usually install Openbox over an existing XFCE4 install and alternate whenever I feel the urge
to use a lightweight desktop (lighter than XFCE4?  You bet.) 

My setup requires the following things be installed, but any can be removed or replaced with your
favorites by modifying the scripts

* compton 
* conky
* lxappearance-obconf 
* nitrogen 
* obconf 
* obmenu 
* openbox
* redshift
* synapse
* tilda
* tint2 
* xscreensaver


Typically these are just an `apt install` or `yum install` away.
