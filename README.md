# openbox_config

Occasionally I get the itch to install the Openbox window manager.  With so many different components
I finally found a good mix that lets me get to working quickly.
This repo contains the setup scripts and files I need to get Openbox setup like I want.

## Dependencies

My setup requires the following things be installed:

* openbox
* obmenu 
* obconf 
* lxappearance-obconf 
* nitrogen 
* xcompmgr 
* tint2 
* tilda

Typically these are just an `apt install` or `yum install` away.
